# 🐦 Indian Bird Species Detection (Deep Learning)

A deep learning–powered computer vision system that identifies **Indian bird species** from images.

Built using **PyTorch**, trained on real-world bird imagery, and designed with scalability, clean inference, and deployment-readiness in mind.

## 🌿 Why This Project Matters

India is home to **1,300+ bird species**, yet biodiversity monitoring is still largely manual.

This project aims to:
- Automate bird species identification
- Support wildlife research & conservation
- Build strong CNN fundamentals for real-world vision tasks
- Move from notebooks → deployable ML systems

## 🧠 Model Overview

- Framework: **PyTorch**
- Task: Multi-class image classification
- Architecture: CNN-based classifier
- Input: RGB bird images
- Output: Bird species label + confidence score

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains images of multiple **Indian bird species**, captured under varying:
- Lighting conditions
- Angles
- Backgrounds

Preprocessing includes:
- Resizing
- Normalization
- Augmentation (optional)

> ⚠️ Dataset not included due to size limitations.
